TODO before the next release:

Standardize the use of "SQL type". I.e., use "measurement type" or "observation type"
or something, but be consistent. I like obs_type. This is a superset of sql_type.

Check that heating and cooling degree days work in metric.

Check unit labels in NOAA year TXT files.

See if the install can be a bit more friendly by merging the unchanged sections 
of weewx.conf.
