TODO before the next release:

Add the skin subdirectory to PYTHONPATH automatically, 
to allow custom skins to find their generators.

Redo and check examples in light of the new archive service.

Document new archive service.

Add stack tracebacks

Remove example of adding a new event to the engine (too advanced!)
