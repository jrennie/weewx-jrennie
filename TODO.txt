TODO before the next release:

Test setup.py to make sure it deletes #upstream.last

Add year-to-date rain feature.

Check example in weewxd.py of how to override the default engine

Move option clock_check to section Station. Move attribute to class StdTimeSynch.
Change docs to reflect.

Edit templates so they are less KORHOODR3 specific.
