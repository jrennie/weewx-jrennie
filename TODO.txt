TODO, in decreasing order of importance.

Installation into a non-standard directory. Should
be able to set the directory in one place and have everything follow.

The startup script /etc/init.d/weewx should be optionally installed.
When requested, it should also make the appropriate entries in /etc/rc?.d

A few "del" here and there might reduce memory requirements.
