CHANGE HISTORY
--------------------------------

1.2.0   11/16/09

Improved axis scaling. The automatic axis scaling routine
now does a better job for ranges less than 1.0. The user can also
hardwire in min and max values, as well as specify a minimum increment, through
parameter 'yscale' in section [Images] in the configuration file.


1.1.0   11/14/09

Added the ability to cache LOOP data. This can dramatically reduce the
number of writes to the stats database, reducing wear on solid-state
disk stores.

Introduced module weewx.mainloop. Introduced class weewx.mainloop.MainLoop
This class offers many opportunities to customize weewx through subclassing,
then overriding an appropriate member function. 

Refactored module weewx.wunderground so it more closely resembles the
(better) logic in wunderfixer.

setup.py no longer installs a daemon startup script to /etc/init.d. It must
now be done by hand.

setup.py now uses the 'home' value in setup.cfg to set WEEWX_ROOT in 
weewx.conf and in the daemon start up scripts

Now uses FTP passive mode by default.

1.0.1   11/09/09

Fixed bug that prevented backfilling the stats database after modifying
the main archive.

1.0.0   10/26/09

Took the module weewx.factory back out, as it was too complicated and
hard to understand.

Added support for generating NOAA monthly and yearly
reports. Completely rewrote the genfiles.py module, to allow easy
subclassing and specialization.

Completely rewrote the stats.py module. All aggregate quantities
are now calculated dynamically.

Labels for HTML generation are now held separately from labels used
for image generation. This allows entities such as '&deg;' to be used
for the former.

LOOP mode now requests only 200 LOOP records (instead of the old
2000). It then renews the request should it run out. This was to get
around an (undocumented) limitation in the VP2 that limits the number
of LOOP records that can be requested to something like 220. This was
a problem when supporting VP2s that use long archive intervals.

Cut down the amount of computing that went on before the processing
thread was spawned, thus allowing the main thread to get back into
LOOP mode more quickly.

Added type 'rainRate' to the types decoded from a Davis archive
record. For some reason it was left out.

Added retries when doing FTP uploads. It will now attempt the upload
several times before giving up.

Much more extensive DEBUG analysis.

Nipped and tucked here and there, trying to simplify.


0.6.5  10/11/09

Ported to Cheetah V2.2.X. Mostly, this is making sure that all strings that
cannot be converted with the 'ascii' codec are converted to Unicode first
before feeding to Cheetah.

0.6.4   9/22/09

Fixed an error in the calculation of heat index.

0.6.3   8/25/09

FTP transfers now default to ACTIVE mode, but a configuration file option allows
PASSIVE mode. This was necessary to support Microsoft FTP servers.

0.6.2   8/1/09

Exception handling in weewx/ftpdata.py used socket.error but failed to declare
it. Added 'import socket' to fix.

Added more complete check for unused pages in weewx/VantagePro.py. Now the entire
record must be filled with 0xff, not just the time field. This fixes a bug where
certain time stamps could look like unused records.

0.6.1   6/22/09

Fixed minor ftp bug.

0.6.0   5/20/09

Changed the file, imaging, ftping functions into objects, so they can be more
easily specialized by the user.

Introduced a StationData object.

Introduced module weewx.factory that produces these things, so the user has a
place to inject his/her new types.

0.5.1	5/13/09

1. Weather Underground thread now run as daemon thread, allowing the program
to exit even if it is running.

2. WU queue now hold an instance of archive and the time to be published, rather
than a record. This allows dailyrain to be published as well.

3. WU date is now given in the format "2009-05-13+12%3A35%3A00" rather than
"2009-05-13 12:35:00". Seems to be more reliable. But, maybe I'm imagining things...
