NEW FEATURES to be added in decreasing order of importance.

Refactor the data collection and generation schemes so that they can be
user extended. The dist_utils package has a pretty good strategy for 
how to do this.

Allow the same SQL type to be used more than once in the config
spec of a plot. Right now, all leaf nodes of the parsed configobj
must have a unique name. This isn't possible if the SQL type is used
more than once.

Add support for CWOP.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

Optional start-of-week besides Sunday.

Better scaling for pond temperatures, rain, and wind direction

Ability to set parameters such as lat, lon, altitude on the VP2

Better wind plots (progressive vector diagram? compass display?)

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX.

Port to Windows.
