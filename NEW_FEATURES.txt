NEW FEATURES to be added in decreasing order of importance.

Noticed during one test that VantagePro.py downloaded a record with 
timestamp 18:02. I deleted the record in archive.sdb and tried again.
Did it again. Obviously, the assumption that all archive intervals are
the same is not correct. I think this happened during a lengthy download
from the VP2 into a virgin database, which spanned the 18:00 boundary.

udev support to compensate for flaky 2101 drivers.

Add support for CWOP.

Save LOOP battery data in the archive file.

Support for APT package.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.
