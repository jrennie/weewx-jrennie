NEW FEATURES to be added in decreasing order of importance.

Make more sidereal calculations available within the templates.
In particular, solar azimuth and elevation.

Make it easy to add new types to the databases. May require
an ability to reconfigure an existing database.

Make the formatting and unit conversion machinery more accessible
to the user. Perhaps remove it from weewx and move it to weeutil?

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Support for APT package.

ET appears only at the top of the hour in an archive record. So,
it's effective archive interval is 60 minutes. Does this carry through?

Support other weather station hardware (will probably require a rewrite of wxengine)

Add support for MySQL.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

Ability to set parameters such as lat, lon, altitude on the VP2

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX.

Port to Windows.
