NEW FEATURES to be added in decreasing order of importance.

Add support for CWOP.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

Optional start-of-week besides Sunday.

Better wind plots (progressive vector diagram? compass display?)

Investigate reducing memory requirements by computing statistical quantities
on the fly instead of storing them in memory.

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX.

Port to Windows.
