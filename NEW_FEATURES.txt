NEW FEATURES to be added in decreasing order of importance.

Save LOOP battery data in the archive file.

Calibration capability.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Noticed during one test that VantagePro.py downloaded a record with 
timestamp 18:02. I deleted the record in archive.sdb and tried again.
Did it again. Obviously, the assumption that all archive intervals are
the same is not correct. I think this happened during a lengthy download
from the VP2 into a virgin database, which spanned the 18:00 boundary.

Add support for MySQL.

Support for APT package.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

Ability to set parameters such as lat, lon, altitude on the VP2

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX.

Port to Windows.
